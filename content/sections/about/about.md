Gatsby creates an outstanding one-page blog in minutes!

It has pre-made sections for your biography, skills, projects, and contact details. If you are a contributor on Github, you can also embed your latest articles in a separate section. When creating the theme, I tried to keep configuration as simple as possible while keeping everything configurable if desired.

Using theme composition, you can easily customize CSS theme to your own preferences - e.g. change colors, fonts, etc.

Last but not least, it has cool features that you can enable: dark mode, splash screen, cookies banner and much more :)
